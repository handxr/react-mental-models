# Chapter 2: UI as a Function of State

One of the most powerful mental models in React is thinking of your user interface as the result of a function that takes some state and returns what should appear on screen. This can be expressed in a simple formula:

```
UI = f(state)
```

Where `f` is your render function and `state` is the data your component needs. This seemingly simple equation represents a profound shift in how we think about building user interfaces.

## The Pure Function Model

In mathematics and functional programming, a pure function is one that:

1. Always returns the same output given the same input
2. Has no side effects

React components are designed to behave like pure functions with respect to their props and state. Given the same state and props, a component should always render the same UI.

Consider this simple component:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

For any value of `name`, this component will predictably render the same greeting. If `name` is "Alice", it will always render "Hello, Alice!". This predictability is at the heart of React's design philosophy.

## State as the Single Source of Truth

In the traditional imperative model, the UI's appearance could be affected by:

- The values of your variables
- The timing of DOM updates
- Hidden state inside the DOM itself

This made it difficult to reason about what the UI would look like at any point in time.

In React's mental model:

1. The component's state (and props) is the single source of truth
2. The UI is derived from this state
3. To change the UI, you change the state
4. React handles updating the DOM to match

This leads to a clear separation between:

- **Data** (state and props)
- **UI description** (what your render function returns)
- **DOM manipulation** (handled by React)

## A Practical Example

Let's see this mental model in action with a simple to-do list:

```jsx
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([
    { id: 1, text: "Learn React", completed: false },
    { id: 2, text: "Build an app", completed: false },
  ]);

  const [newTodoText, setNewTodoText] = useState("");

  function addTodo() {
    if (newTodoText.trim()) {
      setTodos([
        ...todos,
        {
          id: Date.now(),
          text: newTodoText,
          completed: false,
        },
      ]);
      setNewTodoText("");
    }
  }

  function toggleTodo(id) {
    setTodos(
      todos.map((todo) =>
        todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
      )
    );
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <li
            key={todo.id}
            style={{ textDecoration: todo.completed ? "line-through" : "none" }}
            onClick={() => toggleTodo(todo.id)}
          >
            {todo.text}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <input
        value={newTodoText}
        onChange={(e) => setNewTodoText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={addTodo}>Add Todo</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example:

1. The UI is completely determined by the `todos` and `newTodoText` state
2. To add a todo, we update the `todos` state with a new array
3. To toggle a todo's completion, we update the `todos` state with a modified version
4. Each state change triggers a re-render, and React updates the DOM accordingly

## Derivation vs. Duplication

A key insight from this mental model is that data derived from state shouldn't be stored as additional state. Instead, it should be computed during rendering.

### Anti-pattern (duplication):

```jsx
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([
    /* ... */
  ]);
  const [completedCount, setCompletedCount] = useState(0);

  function toggleTodo(id) {
    setTodos(
      todos.map((todo) =>
        todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
      )
    );

    // We have to remember to update this related state!
    const newCompletedCount = todos.filter((t) => t.completed).length;
    setCompletedCount(newCompletedCount);
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Better approach (derivation):

```jsx
function TodoList() {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([
    /* ... */
  ]);

  function toggleTodo(id) {
    setTodos(
      todos.map((todo) =>
        todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
      )
    );
  }

  // Derived value calculated during render
  const completedCount = todos.filter((t) => t.completed).length;

  // ...
}
```

The second approach is superior because:

1. There's no risk of the counts becoming out of sync
2. The code is simpler and has fewer state updates
3. It better follows the "UI as a function of state" model

## Visual Metaphor: The Blueprint Analogy

Think of React components as blueprints rather than construction instructions.

**Imperative approach (construction instructions):**

1. Take a brick and place it here
2. Add mortar
3. Place another brick on top
4. If a window is needed, cut a hole and install the window

**Declarative approach (blueprint):**

1. Here's a complete blueprint of the house
2. When the blueprint changes, the construction team (React) figures out the minimum changes needed

In this analogy:

- Your state is the requirements (3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms)
- Your component is the blueprint
- React is the construction team that determines how to update the existing structure to match the new blueprint

## State Shape Matters

Since your UI is derived from state, the shape of your state significantly impacts how easy it is to reason about your UI.

### Poorly structured state:

```jsx
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
const [isError, setIsError] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState(null);
const [data, setData] = useState(null);

// Now we need to manage multiple state variables in sync
const fetchData = async () => {
  setIsLoading(true);
  setIsError(false);
  setError(null);

  try {
    const result = await api.fetchData();
    setData(result);
  } catch (err) {
    setIsError(true);
    setError(err);
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
};
```

### Better structured state:

```jsx
const [dataState, setDataState] = useState({
  status: "idle", // 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'
  data: null,
  error: null,
});

const fetchData = async () => {
  setDataState({ status: "loading", data: null, error: null });

  try {
    const data = await api.fetchData();
    setDataState({ status: "success", data, error: null });
  } catch (error) {
    setDataState({ status: "error", data: null, error });
  }
};
```

The second approach makes impossible states impossible. For instance, you can't accidentally have both `isLoading` and `isError` be true simultaneously.

## Implications for Component Design

This mental model has profound implications for how we design components:

1. **Identify the minimal state representation**: What's the minimum set of variables needed to fully represent your UI?

2. **Single responsibility**: Components should ideally manage a single concern's state, making them easier to reason about.

3. **Lift state up**: When multiple components need to share state, move it to their closest common ancestor.

4. **Derive everything possible**: Calculate derived values during render rather than storing them as state.

5. **Normalize complex state**: For complex data structures, consider normalized formats that avoid duplication.

## Common Misconceptions

### "I need to update the DOM myself for performance"

With the "UI as function of state" model, developers sometimes worry that re-rendering from state will be inefficient. In practice:

1. React's reconciliation process is highly optimized
2. Virtual DOM diffing ensures minimal actual DOM operations
3. For cases where performance is an issue, solutions like `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` can optimize re-renders without breaking the mental model

### "This approach won't work for complex UIs"

Some developers believe that declarative UI from state only works for simple applications. However, companies like Facebook, Airbnb, and Netflix use this approach for highly complex UIs. The key is breaking down complex UIs into smaller, composable components, each following this mental model.

## Exercise: Identifying State vs. Derived Data

For the following UI elements, identify whether each data point should be state or derived from state:

1. The number of items in a shopping cart
2. Whether a form is valid
3. A filtered list based on a search term
4. The current page in a pagination system
5. Whether a dropdown menu is open or closed
6. The full name formed by combining first and last name
7. The total price of items in a shopping cart

## Exercise: Refactoring to the Mental Model

Refactor this code to better follow the "UI as a function of state" mental model:

```jsx
function UserProfile() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("John");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("Doe");
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState("John Doe");

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
    setFullName(e.target.value + " " + lastName);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
    setFullName(firstName + " " + e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      <p>Full name: {fullName}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Takeaways

- Think of your UI as the result of a function: UI = f(state)
- State should be the single source of truth for your UI
- To change the UI, change the state
- Derive values from state during rendering rather than duplicating data in state
- Design your state shape carefully to make impossible states impossible
- This mental model scales from simple components to complex applications

# Mental Models for React: A Developer's Guide

A comprehensive guide to understanding React through its core mental models rather than just its API. This resource is designed to help developers think in React and build better applications by understanding the why behind React's design.

## What Are Mental Models?

Mental models are frameworks for thinking that help us understand complex systems. In programming, they're how we conceptualize how our code works. Having accurate mental models is often more important than memorizing syntax or APIs.

## How This Book Is Organized

This book is structured to progressively build your understanding of React's mental models:

- **Part 1: Core Mental Models** - The fundamental ways of thinking that make React different

## Table of Contents

### Introduction

- [Introduction: Why Mental Models Matter](introduction/why-mental-models-matter.md)

### Part 1: Core Mental Models

- [Chapter 1: Declarative vs. Imperative UI](part1-core-mental-models/ch1-declarative-vs-imperative.md)

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is designed to be read sequentially, as each chapter builds on the mental models introduced before it. However, experienced React developers might want to jump to specific chapters to strengthen particular mental models.

Each chapter includes:

- Explanations of the core concept with simple analogies
- Code examples that highlight the mental model
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Exercises to reinforce understanding
- Visual diagrams where appropriate
